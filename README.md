# 👨‍💼 Company portal
The Company Portal Web Application is a comprehensive employee management system designed to streamline administrative tasks and enhance organizational efficiency. It offers essential **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities to manage employee records.


## 🚀 Feature
- **User Authentication**: Upon login, the system validates user credentials such as username and password. If the user hasn't registered yet, the system provides an option to register as a new user, guiding them through the registration process.

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Administrators are granted privileged access to administrative functions, while non-administrative users are restricted to viewing employee information only.

- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: The dashboard interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, giving administrators quick access to all the important features they need.

- **Default profile image**: If a user didn't upload any picture for their profile image, the system automatically assigns a default template image. This ensures that every user has a profile image, even if they haven't uploaded one themselves.

## 💭 Process
It was the first time for me to actually handle data on the database through PHP and create a dynamic web application that manages data. One of the more challenging aspects involved handling images. Specifically, when updating profile images, I encountered complexity in displaying the current images on the update page, leading to some struggles as I worked through this operation.

## 🌈 Improvement
- Strengthening password security by implementing stricter password settings with additional validation conditions could enhance overall system security.
- Allowing non-admin users to update only their working hours and view monthly reports in chart format would improve user experience.
